# iNetStorm: Python Network Testing Tool for Unified DoS Testing.

Command Line python script top perfom a variety of networking tests
It aims to unify DoS test behind a simple script (In version 2 maybe a GUI), abstracting much of the backend work to enable developers to focus on other things.
**Warning:** This script is published for educational purposes only! Author will accept no responsibility for any consequences, damage or loss which might result from use.

iNetStorm is a Python script designed to perform a wide range of networking tests, with a focus on unifying Denial of Service (DoS) testing through a simple command. This powerful tool enables comprehensive evaluations of network resilience and security.

Key features of iNetStorm:

Unified DoS testing: iNetStorm streamlines the DoS testing process by integrating various methods and attacks into a single tool.
Control and precision: Configure and customize test parameters such as attack intensity, duration, and target, allowing for precise and controlled testing.
Realistic simulation: iNetStorm realistically emulates attacks, enabling the evaluation of network and system resilience under adverse conditions.
Intuitive interface: iNetStorm provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for quick test initiation, termination, and parameter customization.
Detailed reports: Generate comprehensive reports with statistics and relevant metrics, enabling in-depth analysis of network response to different attack types.
iNetStorm is an ideal tool for assessing network security and conducting controlled resilience tests. Strengthen your system against DoS attacks by identifying potential vulnerabilities using iNetStorm's precise and comprehensive testing capabilities.
