## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us confidentially by sending an email to [brallanzenteno@gmail.com](mailto:brallanzenteno@gmail.com). Do not create a public issue on GitHub, as this could expose the vulnerability to others before we have had a chance to address it.

Please include the following details in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggestions for fixing the vulnerability, if you have any.

We will respond to your report within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt. We will then work to understand and address the issue as quickly as possible, keeping you informed of our progress.

After the vulnerability is resolved, we will publish a security advisory along with credit to those who reported the issue, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping to keep iNetStorm safe and secure for everyone!
